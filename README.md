## Repository Overview

This repository, named **GSAP**, contains various folders and files showcasing different animation techniques using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform).

### Folder 1: Animation üé¨‚ú®

The `animation` folder contains the following files:

- **index.html**: This file demonstrates applying animations on headings and boxes. The HTML structure includes headings within a div and multiple divs representing boxes. External styles and scripts are linked, including GSAP from a CDN. The animations are applied through the `script.js` file.
- **style.css**: This file contains basic styling for the elements, including the boxes and headings. It sets margins, paddings, font-family, and dimensions for the boxes.
- **script.js**: This script file applies GSAP animations to the headings and boxes. The headings are animated with opacity changes, movement, and repetition. The boxes are animated with movements, rotations, color changes, and border-radius transformations using GSAP timelines.
